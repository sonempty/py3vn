Data Types
**********

The modules described in this chapter provide a variety of specialized data
types such as dates and times, fixed-type arrays, heap queues, synchronized
queues, and sets.

Python also provides some built-in data types, in particular,
:class:`dict`, :class:`list`, :class:`set` and :class:`frozenset`, and
:class:`tuple`.  The :class:`str` class is used to hold
Unicode strings, and the :class:`bytes` class is used to hold binary data.

The following modules are documented in this chapter:
