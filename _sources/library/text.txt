Text Processing Services

The modules described in this chapter provide a wide range of string
manipulation operations and other text processing services.

The :mod:`codecs` module described under :ref:`binaryservices` is also
highly relevant to text processing. In addition, see the documentation for
Python's built-in string type in :ref:`textseq`.
